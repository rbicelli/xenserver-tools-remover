# Xenserver Tools Remover

After a week of trying exporting a vm from xen for importing in other Hypervisors and hundreds of BSODs, I wrote this script which clean the leftovers of Citrix Tools.

This solves the **INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE** error and **SYSTEM_TREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED** error.

Usage: launch the script and watch the magic.
